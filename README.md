Logs in to GMeet and attends your online class, and automatically leaves once 3/4 of the class has left.
Joins with dummy camera and mic, both off.
Also has a response feature where it can play a recording upon your name being called (currently uses Google Captions, might switch to another speech-to-text software later)
Mainly uses selenium and webbrowser modules in python3
Designed for Chrome+Windows

NOTE:Remember to customise the login-details file with email-id, password and Meet code in consecutive lines. Ensure that there are no whitespaces.
