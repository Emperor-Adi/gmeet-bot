16 Nov '20

Initial Release (v0.5)


Download, edit the textfile (named login-details.txt) and run the .exe file

Runs Google Chrome on Windows 10.

python3 modules used: Selenium and Webbrowser


Logs in to GMeet, attends your online class, and automatically leaves once 75% of the class has left. Joins with dummy camera and mic, both off. Remember to customise the login-details file with email-id, password and Meet code in consecutive lines. Ensure that there are no whitespaces.

Oh, and pay attention to class ;-P


(I'm currently working on upgrades to answer attendance as well as expansion to other browsers and platforms)
