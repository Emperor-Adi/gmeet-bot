# gmeet-bot

Currently runs Google Chrome on Windows 10.


Logs in to GMeet, attends your online class, and automatically leaves once 75% of the class has left. Joins with dummy camera and mic, both off. Remember to customise the login-details file with email-id, password and Meet code in consecutive lines. Ensure that there are no whitespaces.

Oh, and pay attention to class ;-P


(I'm currently working on upgrades to answer when your name is called as well as on expansion to other browsers and platforms)
Head over to active-dev branch to check out the latest additions.
